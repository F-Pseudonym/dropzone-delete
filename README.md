# dropzone-delete
Delete Action for Dropzone

## Overview
This action can be added to Dropzone 3 for Mac (https://aptonic.com/).

When dragging any number of files or folders to this action, the dragged items are deleted right after a dialogue (for safety reasons). No moving to recycle bin, no need to empty it.

## Install Instructions
Download the latest version, unzip it and simply click on the Dropzone action named "Delete.dzbundle". If you have Dropzone 3 installed, the action should be added there automatically. Choose "add to grid" to have it up and running immediately.
